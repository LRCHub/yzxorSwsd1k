Flash
Ah-ah
Saviour of the universe

Flash
Ah-ah
He'll save every one of us

(Seemingly there is no reason for these extraordinary intergalactical upsets)
(What's happening Flash?) (Only Dr. Hans Zarkov)
(Formerly at NASA, has provided any explanation)

Flash
Ah-ah
He's a miracle
(This mornings unprecedented solar eclipse is no cause for alarm)
Flash
Ah-ah
King of the impossible

He's for every one of us
Stand for every one of us
He'll save with a mighty hand
Every man, every woman, every child with a mighty Flash

(General Kala, Flash Gordon approaching)
(What do you mean "Flash Gordon approaching?")
(Open fire! All weapons!)
(Dispatch war rocket Ajax to bring back his body)

Flash
Ah-ah
(Gordon's alive)
Flash
Ah-ah
He'll save every one of us

Just a man, with a man's courage
He knows nothing but a man
But he can never fail
No one but the pure in heart may find the golden grail
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh

Flash, Flash, I love you
But we only have 14 hours to save the Earth
